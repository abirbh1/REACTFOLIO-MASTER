		description:
			"My academic journey began in Tunisia, where I earned an engineering degree in computer science. Driven by a strong passion for intelligent systems, I also completed a research-based master’s degree in advanced systems at the same school. From my early research experiences, I became fascinated by the fields of recommender systems and customer profiling, which combine programming, data analysis, and the resolution of complex problems. I have always viewed Canada as a hub of research excellence, known for its high academic standards and collaborative opportunities. This aspiration led me to complete my master’s thesis internship in Canada, at the Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue (UQAT). This enriching experience further strengthened my desire to pursue studies in a high-level research environment. My growing interest in operations and optimization led me to discover the Faculty of Business Administration (FSA) at Université Laval, renowned for its expertise in these areas—particularly through the CIRRELT research center. This innovative lab convinced me that FSA was the ideal place to sharpen my skills and achieve my goals. Moreover, my partner, who was already pursuing a master’s degree at FSA, recommended the institution to me, which further confirmed my decision. Since my admission, studying at FSA has allowed me to develop a broader and deeper understanding of decision-support systems, logistics, and modeling. These skills are central to my current research project, which focuses on optimizing bidding strategies in freight transportation. Working in such a stimulating environment has helped me strike a valuable balance between academic rigor and the practical application of knowledge. My studies at FSA ULaval will have a significant impact on both my academic and professional journey. They enable me to combine my expertise in artificial intelligence and optimization to tackle real-world challenges, while reinforcing my ambition to contribute to innovation in intelligent systems. Ultimately, I aim to grow into a leadership role where I can design innovative and strategic solutions for complex organizations."},
